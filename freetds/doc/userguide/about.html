It is the product of (lots of) happy collaborative effort.  Although Brian's name and mine are at the top of it, behind it are many others, who contributed thoughtful suggestions, bamboozled questions, stellar prose, and terse instructions.  I don't mention this for the usual reasons (the enumeration of which I leave to you) but rather to emphasize that the purpose of our effort is to help you and those who come after you to have the easiest and most enjoyable time with <span class="productname">FreeTDS</span>.</p><p>It is surprisingly hard, after a while, to remember how it can be for someone newly approaching a project to use it.  What seems as obvious as a fog horn to an old hand may be much more like the fog itself to the newcomer.  That can make installing and setting up new software a puzzling or frustrating experience.  You may have heard, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">It's easy if you know how.</span>”</span>  Indeed it is, and that's our purpose here: to make it easy, by letting you know how.</p><p>This guide is here for you, and we hope that you will be here for it, that others might benefit from your experience or inexperience.  The most recent version <a href="#ftn.idm66974448" class="footnote" id="idm66974448"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a>
		can be found on the <span class="productname">FreeTDS</span>
		<a class="ulink" href="https://www.freetds.org/userguide/" target="_top">web site</a>, where you will also find
		links to the anonymous and browseable git repository.
		If you find something wrong, unclear, badly put, misleading, or incorrigible, I hope you will let us know.
		Post your musings or rants to the GitHub project (see <a class="link" href="contrib.html" title="Chapter 10. Helping">Helping</a>).
		Patches to <code class="filename">doc/userguide.xml</code> are especially welcome, of course.
		By taking the time let us know what you think, perhaps the path to enlightenment will be made a little smoother for the fellow behind you.</p><p>A few technical notes.  This guide is written in XML DocBook format, specifications for which are found in the <a class="ulink" href="https://tdg.docbook.org/tdg/4.5/docbook.html" target="_top">DocBook book</a>.
