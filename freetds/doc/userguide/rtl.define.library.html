	Like a static library, a dynamic library is a collection of functions with a table of contents.
	They are referenced at build time to give the executable information about how they will eventually be used,
	but they aren't <span class="emphasis"><em>used</em></span> until run time.</p><p>Dynamic libraries are part of the run-time environment.  When a program is run, the run-time linker finds the dynamic libraries needed by the program, finds the addresses of the required functions, and assembles a runable image in memory.  Missing libraries and/or missing functions — or the wrong versions of them — can lead to head-scratching and other amusing behavior.  </p><p>In Windows® dynamic libraries are called <em class="firstterm">dynamic link libraries</em> (DLLs).  In Unix they're normally called <em class="firstterm">shared objects</em>.  But they're roughly the same thing.    </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" summary="Note: What about .h files?"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.gif" /></td><th align="left">What about <code class="literal">.h</code> files?</th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>C header files include <em class="firstterm">functional prototypes</em>, declarations (not <span class="emphasis"><em>definitions)</em></span> of functions.  Functional prototypes describe to the compiler each function's parameters, allowing the compiler to confirm that the function is being called correctly.  </p><p>Most of the functions declared in header files are implemented in libraries.  However, there's <span class="emphasis"><em>no mechanical or automatic relationship</em></span> between the functional prototypes in the header files and their implementation in a library.  The <code class="literal">.h</code> file is maintained by hand, by the programmer, and is used to generate a library.  The header file and associated library are distributed and installed together (one hopes), but correct installation and subsequent use by the compiler &amp; linker require human beings to keep track of the pair.  Failure to do so leads to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">interesting</span>”</span> development and even run-time problems, especially with libraries whose functions' parameters change from version to version. </p><p>For example, imagine a function <code class="literal">f(int g)</code> defined in library <code class="filename">libf.so</code> and declared in <code class="filename">f.h</code>.  In a later version of <code class="filename">libf.so</code>, the function's parameter is changed to use a pointer, <code class="literal">f(int *p)</code>, and <code class="filename">f.h</code> is likewise updated.  Possible errors that cannot be prevented by the linker include: 

</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>An old program could use the new library.  Probably the integer it passes will be interpreted as an out-of-bounds address, resulting in a segmentation violation.   </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>A new program could use the old library, passing an address that the library interprets as an integer.  Hillarity ensues.  </p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Existing source code could be compiled using the old header file but linked to the new library.  If you've never done that, give it time.   </p></li></ol></div><p>

These errors are possible because C functions are identified to the linker <span class="emphasis"><em>by name only</em></span>.  On the upside, that makes the tools simple and easy to implement and, by the same token, simplifies the use of C libraries by other languages.  The downside is that the work of ensuring that the right libraries are used becomes an administrative task instead of a technical one.   </p></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="footnotes"><br /><hr style="width:100; text-align:left;margin-left: 0" /><div id="ftn.idm70653808" class="footnote"><p><a href="#idm70653808" class="para"><sup class="para">[34] </sup></a>The Unix convention is to put in parentheses behind the name the section of the manual in which the function is documented.  <span class="productname">FreeTDS</span> functions don't get numbers because they're not in the manual.
