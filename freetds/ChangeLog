    Fix ABI breakage for tdsdump_open under Windows

    tdsdump_open is exported by our DB-Library implementation.
    Before version 1.5 tdsdump_open always accepted a "const char*"
    string, however in 1.5 this was changed to "const wchar_t*" for
    Windows to support Unicode.
    This broke ABI for Windows.
    Provide tdsdump_open with old ABI and a new tdsdump_wopen
    (Windows only).

    odbc: Accept any variable data type using DATA_AT_EXEC length

    Reported in https://github.com/FreeTDS/freetds/issues/667.

    The behaviour is consistent with Microsoft driver.

    This caused an issue using PHP ODBC PDO driver.

    Use CORK flag correctly, do not delay partial packets

    Resetting TCP_CORK flag in Linux causes the partial packets
    to be flushed however if the queue is full partial packets
    are not moved to the queue.
    Partial packets are then processed when space is available.
    However FreeTDS used to set again the flag causing partial
    packets to be delayed.
    Remove that delay reducing latency.

    VMS has had vsnprintf for a long time

    And this allows for a better vasprintf fallback for systems where
    vasprintf is not available.

    tsql: Avoid possible invalid type formatting a message

    Specifically:

    long should be enough for 49 days in case of 32 bit, I hope
    your query doesn't take so long.
