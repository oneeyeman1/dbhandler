# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and from version 0.9.0 onwards this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2024-02-18

**wxPdfDocument** is compatible with wxWidgets versions 3.2.x and above.

### Added

- Added support for document protection with AES-256 encryption (PDF 2.0).
- Added support for importing PDF documents protected with AES encryption.

### Changed

- The library now requires a C++11 compiler for compilation.
- Build support for Visual C++ versions below 2015 has been removed.

### Fixed

- Fixed problem with page breaks in XML tables.

## [1.1.0] - 2024-01-27

### Changed

- The signature of methods `ScaleX`, `ScaleY`, `ScaleXY`, `Scale`, `MirrorH`, `MirrorV`, `SkewX`, `SkewY`, `Skew`, `Rotate`, and `UseTemplate` has been changed to get rid of the negative default values for the position parameters. This was necessary to support negative coordinates in all graphics operations. If an application had explicitly specified the default value (`-1`) in calls to one of the above methods, these values have to be replaced by calls to method `GetX` resp `GetY`.

### Fixed

- Fixed issue #92 "Rotated text at wrong position". The problem arose from the use of negative coordinates. All graphics operations now support negative coordinates, too.
- Fixed output of wrong text background colour for rotated text in `wxPdfDC`.

## [1.0.3] - 2023-11-16

### Fixed

- Fixed handling of long table: take top page margin, page header and table header into account for page breaks.
- Fixed handling for empty table bodies.
- Fixed handling of the height of (optional) table header rows (taking it into account for calculating table parts fitting on a page).
- Fixed isue #81. Improve handling of table cell borders in markup. Table cell borders could be (partially) hidden by table cell backgrounds.
- Actually use wxPdfDocument::GetImageSize() MIME type parameter.
- Fixed handling of surrogates for TrueType fonts.
- Fixed problem with automatic page break

## [0.9.0] - 2010-12-29

**wxPdfDocument** is compatible with wxWidgets version 2.8.11 and version 2.9.1.
Compatibility with older wxWidgets versions is not guaranteed.

This is the first release of **wxPdfDocument** containing a **PDF drawing context** (`wxPdfDC`).
There are implementations for wxWidgets 2.8.x and 2.9.x; the matching implementation
is selected automatically at compile time. Please report your experiences with `wxPdfDC`
to the author of **wxPdfDocument**, be it bug reports, contributions or feature requests.

### Added

- methods to draw Bezier splines through a list of points;
the drawing sample has been extended to show the new functionality
- PDF drawing context (`wxPdfDC`); not yet all methods are implemented
- support for fonts with VOLT (_Visual Ordering and Layout Tables_) data
(currently visual ordering only, preprocessing of the fonts required);
fonts for 9 Indic scripts are included to demonstrate this feature

### Changes

- increased output speed for method `SaveAsFile` (if large graphics files are involved)
- all currently supported CJK font families are now registered automatically at startup of the font manager
- MS CJK fonts aren't automatically registered as Type0 fonts,
since this conflicts with registering these fonts as TrueType Unicode fonts
- handling of image masks has been improved

### Fixed

- opening font files could fail if the file path contained non-latin characters
Now `wxFileSystem::FileNameToURL` is used to create valid file names for use in method `wxFileSystem::OpenFile` 
- invalid format codes in method `wxPdfUtility::Double2String` could cause problems in _MinGW_ environment
- registering half-width CJK fonts didn't work
- bug in page size handling
- no file was written when `Close` was called before `SaveAsFile`
- bug in the handling of transparency for image masks
- uninitialized member variables in layer objects possibly causing invisibility of layers
- cleaned up output formatting codes for building on 64-bit systems
- compile time bugs for wxWidgets built with `wxUSE_STL`
- several minor bugs

## [0.8.5] - 2009-10

**wxPdfDocument** is compatible with wxWidgets version 2.8.10. Some preparations were done
to make **wxPdfDocument** compatible with version 2.9.x and above, too.

### Added (**all** builds)

- support for individual page sizes
- support for setting fill rule to _odd/even_ or _winding_
- support for setting the text render mode
- support for layers (optional content groups)
- support for patterns as draw and fill colours
- support for Code 128 barcodes

### Added (**Unicode** build)

- support for kerning
- support for different encodings for Type1 and TrueType fonts
- support for using TrueType and OpenType fonts loaded directly from `.ttf` or `.otf` file
- support for using Type1 fonts loaded directly from `.pfb` and `.afm` file
- support for using TrueType and OpenType fonts defined by a `wxFont` object
- font subsetting for OpenType Unicode fonts (experimental, currently non-CID fonts only)
- direct positioning and writing of glyph numbers for TrueType/OpenType Unicode fonts (this may be used in conjunction with tools for writing complex scripts like ICU)

### Added (**ANSI** build)

- support for fonts defined by a wxFont object (mapped by family, weight and style to the Adobe core fonts)

### Changes

- coordinate transformation (location of origin and y axis orientation)
is now done directly in PDF. This was a prerequisite to add `wxGraphicsContext` support
in an upcoming version. User unit scaling is done programmatically.
- unified the naming of all methods manipulating colours. Now always the
British spelling is used, i.e. _colour_ instead of _color_.

### Fixed

- line style measurements did not use user units
- encryption support for big endian platforms
- method `wxPdfDocument::ClippingText`

## [0.8.0] - 2006-12

**wxPdfDocument** is compatible with wxWidgets version 2.8.0 as well as with version 2.6.x.

### Added

- support for external templates: pages of existing PDF documents may be imported and used as templates
- font subsetting for TrueType and TrueType Unicode fonts, often resulting in much smaller PDF file sizes
- support for using and embedding OpenType Unicode fonts
- enhanced support for password based encryption, encryption key length freely definable between 40 and 128 bits (**Attention**: Adobe Reader supports only keys with 40 or 128 bits.)
- support for AES encryption (additional standard encryption method in PDF version 1.6 and above)

### Changes

- As an add-on preprocessed font files for the free [DejaVu fonts](http://dejavu.sourceforge.net)
(version 2.12) are provided in the file release [wxPdfDocument Add-Ons](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=51305&package_id=45182&release_id=468705).

- For supporting font subsetting for ordinary non-Unicode TrueType fonts
the format of the font definition files has been extended. Font definition files created
with prior versions of the `makefont` utility are still usable, but do not support font subsetting.
It is recommended to regenerate own font definition files. Unfortunately common AFM font metric
files do not contain glyph information which is required by the `makefont` utility to create the
character-to-glyph mapping. Therefore the utility `ttf2ufm` had to be changed.
The modified version including a Windows executable is available in the file release [wxPdfDocument Add-Ons](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=51305&package_id=45182&release_id=468705).

## [0.7.6] - 2006-10

**wxPdfDocument** is now compatible with wxWidgets version 2.7.1 and above as well as with version 2.6.x.

### Added

- setting/getting the default path used for loading font files
- getting the description of the current font
- loading images from a wxInputStream (in addition to loading from file or wxImage)

**Attention**: The structure of the font definition files has changed due to
the addition of the font attribute `xHeight`. It is necessary to regenerate own
font definition files using `makefont`. To support the `xHeight` attribute the utility
`ttf2ufm` had to be changed.

### Fixed

## [0.6] - 2005-11

### Added

- gradients
- transformations
- barcodes
- `makefont` utility

### Changed
